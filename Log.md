# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 1 : Oct 25, 2018

**Today's Progress** : I have setup all the things I needed to complete this challenge. I have taken the dataset (SF Salaries) from kaggle.

**Thoughts** : Hope this challenge will be exiciting, will help me in learning Machine Learning in a more effective way.

## Day 2 : Oct 26, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Worked on fake data about some purchases done through Amazon!

**Thoughts** : It was really fun.

## Day 3 : Oct 27, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Created some basic visualization using matplotlib and learning seaborn library for visualization which is built on top of matplotlib.

**Thoughts** : Seaborn is high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics. It is a handy tool for visualization.

## Day 4 : Oct 28, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Learning seaborn library for visualization is completed. Created visualization by taking Titanic dataset by using seaborn.

**Thoughts** : With Seaborn, we can plot, attractive charts in a Simple way.

## Day 5 : Oct 29, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Created visualization by taking different type datasets by using plotly.

**Thoughts** : Plotly allow us to create interactive visualizations and easy to share.

## Day 6 : Oct 30, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Worked on data analysis for Emergency - 911 Calls dataset from kaggle. Data analysis of bank stock prices and see how they progressed throughout the financial crisis all the way to early 2016.

## Day 7 : Oct 31, 2018

**Today's Progress** : I have implemented Linear regression model algorithm and used it to prediction on a customer data of a eCommerce company.

## Day 8 : Nov 1, 2018

**Today's Progress** : I have implemented Linear regression model algorithm from scratch and used it to prediction on a customer data of a eCommerce company.

**Thoughts** : Yesterday, I used scikit learn library for predicting data. Today, I have implemented from scratch without scikit library, it was really a great experience.

## Day 9 : Nov 2, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Fine tuned the Linear Regression model algorithm.

## Day 10 : Nov 3, 2018

**Today's Progress** : I have implemented "Multiple Linear Regression" model on 50 startup companies dataset from kaggle. Finding the optimal model using backward elimination.

## Day 11 : Nov 4, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Implementing "Multiple Linear Regression" model from scratch.

**Thoughts** : Machine Learning become more fun when these algorithms are implementing from scratch, it was really a great experience.
